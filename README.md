# Heat-Integration
The purpose of this code is to produce a graph to assist with heat integration in a chemical plant. The code will produce a graph that shows how close the hot and cold streams come to crossing, from which the engineer can assess how they can most efficiently trade energy between streams. The code is quite onoptimised as I was working under a very tight deadline for this one
